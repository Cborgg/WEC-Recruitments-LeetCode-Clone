# WEC-Recruitments-LeetCode-Clone
FireCode is the name of my LeetCode clone, and can be used as a platform for developers to practice coding problems and improve their skills. This project was created as a full-stack project using Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, TypeScript,TypeScript React (TSX), CSS3, and Tailwind CSS.

# Demo

# Installation

### Clone the repository and install server and client dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ManiGhazaee/FireCode.git
cd FireCode/server
npm install
cd ../client
npm install
```

### Start the client in the `client` directory:

```bash
npm start
```

### Configure the MongoDB Database and JWT Secret:

Before starting the server, make sure to configure the following environment variables in the `server/.env` file:

-   `MONGODB_URI`: Set this variable to your MongoDB connection string.
-   `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`: Set this variable to a secret key for JWT access tokens.

### Configure the API URL:

To use your own API, open the `client/src/App.tsx` file and find the `API_URL` constant. Update its value to match the URL of your deployed server (`http://localhost:80`).

### Start the server in the `server` directory:

```bash
npm start
```
